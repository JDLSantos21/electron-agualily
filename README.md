# Electron-AguaLily

Electron-AguaLily is a management application that I have been developing to be able to keep an organized control of the activities carried out in the company. The objective of this is to be able to reuse the information collected and not just store it on paper, thus saving time and showing greater transparency to the activities carried out.

All these activities in one way or another did not have an exact control and something was required to be able to monitor them and have direct control.

## FUEL SECTION

Previously in the company a notebook was used to take notes of each of the vehicles and to be able to put the data of the spent fuel of each vehicle. This is somewhat impractical because apart from that, a sheet of a notebook had to be established for that vehicle and when that sheet was filled out, another had to be established, thus breaking the order of the vehicles.

Apart from this, there was no control of how much fuel was in reserve, thus causing the vehicles to stop production when the fuel ran out.

#### Fuel availability

By clicking on the 'Availability' button, the current fuel availability section is displayed, which interacts as consumption or refueling is recorded, respectively.

#### View recorded data
In this section you can see the data already registered, with their respective filters. You can filter by vehicle number, from a date, between dates and all this combined.

When a particular vehicle number is filtered, a calculation is made of how much is the approximate consumed by that vehicle. In case there is a failure, it will be notified with different alerts.
